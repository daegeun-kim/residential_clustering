        Manhattan's residential buildings can be described by 
        characteristics such as construction year, height,
        and transit access. These factors enable classifications
        into distinct clusters: socio-spatial, morpho-economic,
        accessibility-value, and beyond.

        The dataset was constructed by combining and processing information from multiple sources.
        All records were merged at the building level using the BIN (Building Identification Number)
        as the unique key. Since several original datasets were provided at the tax lot level, 
        these entries were duplicated and expanded to align with individual buildings.<br><br>

          Housing construction in Manhattan has been relatively steady over the past two centuries, 
          peaking in the early 20th century. The oldest residential buildings are concentrated in 
          West Village and Soho, while the newest developments cluster along the Hudson River and Roosevelt Island.

          The tallest residential buildings in Manhattan are concentrated in Lower Manhattan and along the Hudson River.

          under 100 feet.<br>

          Subway access is most convenient in Midtown and Lower Manhattan, where stations are densely concentrated. 
          In contrast, parts of the East Village and areas along the Hudson River are the farthest from stations. 
          Overall, however, the majority of buildings are within a 5-minute walk to the nearest subway.<br>

          The average property value per residential building highlights the social divide across Manhattan. 
          The most expensive properties cluster on the Upper East and Upper West Sides, while the least expensive 
          are concentrated in the East Village, Chinatown, and Upper Manhattan.<br>

          Per-square-foot property values are highest in the Upper East Side and Soho, and lowest in Upper Manhattan. 
          Notably, Soho buildings tend to have below-average total property values but the highest per-square-foot 
          values in Manhattan, reflecting smaller housing units that are exceptionally expensive relative to their size.<br>

          Most properties in Manhattan experienced a steady increase in market value between 2024 and 2025. 
          However, notable pockets of decline are concentrated in Soho and Harlem, where many buildings show 
          negative growth. In contrast, sharp spikes in value are observed in the East Village, 
          the Upper East Side, and Washington Heights, highlighting areas of rapid appreciation.<br>

          Most residential buildings in Manhattan are classified as multifamily elevator buildings or mixed-use 
          residential and commercial properties. Less common types, such as one- and two-family homes and multifamily 
          walk-up buildings, are primarily found in the West Village, Upper East Side, and Harlem.<br>

          <br>
          Nearly two-thirds of Manhattan’s residential buildings lack elevators, reflecting the prevalence of low-rise housing, 
          especially in neighborhoods on the East and West Sides. In contrast, elevator-equipped buildings, though fewer in number, 
          are generally larger in scale and more prominent on the map.<br>

          Tall, large-scale residential buildings with substantial gross floor area are concentrated 
          along the waterfront. In contrast, smaller houses and walk-up buildings dominate neighborhoods 
          such as Soho and Chinatown. Around Central Park, most buildings feature expansive

          Most buildings in Manhattan are either fully residential or entirely non-residential, even within tax classes 1 and 2. 
          Waterfront properties are more likely to be 100% residential, while buildings in Midtown and Soho often allocate 
          significant portions of their space to commercial or mixed uses.<br>
